A small React + React router + MobX boilerplate.

- `npm start`: start in development mode;
- `npm start:prod`: start in production mode (only after build process);
- `npm run build:all`: build server and client bundles for production;
- `npm run build:client`: build client bundles;
- `npm run build:server`: build server bundle;
- `npm run clean:builds`: delete all generated bundles;
